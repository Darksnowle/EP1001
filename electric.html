                  <h1><u>Electronics Production</u></h1>
                      <p>For the start of my Further Digital Fabrication and Prototyping(FDFAB) journey, we were introduced to CNC Machines, and also Printed Circuit Boards (also known as PCB). Previously, we were able to create our own design/creations with the use of an arduino, a microcontroller, where we can easily programme through its own software and connect other input and output devices to it. As for PCBs, we have to actually come up with our own board designs, before we are able to programme and add any devices to it.</p>
                      
                    <h1>Printed Circuit Boards (PCB)</h1>
                      <p>So what is a PCB? A PCB mechanically supports and electrically connects electrical or electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. <b>Why</b> do we make PCBs? When we create our own PCBs, we are able to customize the electronics to meet product requirements, the footprint of product, theres a greater reliability, ability to prototype and iterate faster and last but not least, it provides a better product integration. The first PCB that we were taught was called the <b>In-System Programer(ISP)</b> board.</p>
                      
                      <h1>In-System Programer(ISP)</h1>
                      <p>An ISP also called in-circuit serial programming is the ability of some programmable logic devices, microcontrollers, and other embedded devices to be programmed while installed in a complete system, rather than requiring the chip to be programmed prior to installing it into the system. It allows firmware updates to be delivered to the on-chip memory of microcontrollers and related processors without requiring specialist programming circuitry on the circuit board, and simplifies design work. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming target="_blank">(Source: Wikipedia)</a></p>
                      
                      <p>For our first individual assignment, we were tasked to convert 2 PNG images of a ISP board to gcode to be milled by the CNC machine.</p>
