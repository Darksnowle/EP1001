                      <h2>Ideation</h2>
                      <p>For this project i will be working alongside Danish. Our idea is to make a hand and conveyor belt system in which he will work on the robotic arm and i will work on the conveyor belt. The idea is based off a project done by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNy8OJafm0U&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=RoboticsLearner">Robotics Learner</a> where he had a system which senses the object logo and prints out what logo is on it. Since the knowledge is currently way out of my scope and also since we do not have alot of time, I discussed with Danish and come to an agreement where we just have to sense an object on the conveyor belt, make it stop for a bit and continue again.</p>
                      
                      <h2>Design</h2>
                      <p>I tried to follow designs from conveyor belts online but it is rare to see a DIY one made out of wood. Some pictures i got my ideas from are seen below.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/fdfab/conveyor.jpg"><img src="images/final/fdfab/conveyor.jpg" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>My first draw up is as seen below. The top is for the ultrasonic sensor. However, there are multiple problems I came across. Firstly, there is no proper place to store my electronics in. Secondly, There isn't any slots or holder for the rollers.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/firstdesign.PNG"><img src="images/final/firstdesign.PNG" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>I went ahead and editted my design. I made changes so as to adress the problems that i came across so having a place to put all the electronics and also for the rollers. The final design looks as such with the motor adapter and also a slot below the contraption itself for the electronics.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/fdfab/fusion.PNG"><img src="images/final/fdfab/fusion.PNG" width=800></a>
                      <i>Fusion design</i>
                      <a href="images/final/adapter.PNG"><img src="images/final/adapter.PNG" width=800></a>
                      <i>Motor Adapter</i>
                      <a href="images/final/back.PNG"><img src="images/final/back.PNG" width=800></a>
                      <i>Slot for electronics</i>
                      
                      <p>The whole design is about 300x120x60 mm in size. The whole thing would be made out of CNC wood of thickness 15mm. As for the rollers as seen above, will be cut out using the laser cutter since it is thinner. The holder for the rollers will be out of pencils from my household.</p>
                      
                      <h2>Creation</h2>
                      <p>Once i got the design im happy with, we now have to cut out the thing itself. Initially before cutting, i first save each face as a DXF file. To do so, simply just creat a sketch on each face then right click the sketch and save it as a DXF file. As for the motor adapter however, that will be 3D printed so i simply right click the component and save it as an STL file.</p>
                      
                      <p>For the cutting, we will be doing it in the T11 FabLAB. Once there on the computer, we have to import our different DXF files to VCarve Pro.</p>
                      
                      <p>First thing to do on VCarve Pro is to obviously create a new file. Once created, make sure that the <b>Job size Width and Height</b> is 1200mm. Once that is done, I can then import in my DXF files. To move the drawing around, simply just click on the <b>Transform Mode</b> under the <b>Edit Objects</b> tab.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/VCARVEPRO2.png"><img src="images/final/cutting/VCARVEPRO2.png" width=800></a>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/VCARVEPRO3.png"><img src="images/final/cutting/VCARVEPRO3.png" width=800></a>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/movetool.PNG"><img src="images/final/cutting/movetool.PNG" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>Once the drawings have been moved nicely to the canvas, we now need to do a dogbone fillet to connecting corners to allow for a nice snug fit. To do that, simply just click on the <b>Fillet</b> button under the <b>Edit Objects</b> tab and select <b>'Dog-Bone' Fillet</b>. Make sure that the radius is 3mm as we will be using a 6mm endmill with 3mm diameter. Then just click on corners where parts are going to connect to one another, Example is shown below.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/dogbone1.PNG"><img src="images/final/cutting/dogbone1.PNG" width=800></a>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/dogbone2.PNG"><img src="images/final/cutting/dogbone2.PNG" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>After that we will be proceeding to the <b>Toolpath</b> section. Simply click on the Toolpath button at the top right of the screen. Once there, we will be selecting <b>Profile Toolpath</b>. In the toolpath settings, we first want to make sure that the right tool is used so click on select and choose the 6mm endmill and change the number of passes to 3 to minimise time spent cutting.</p>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/toolpath2.png"><img src="images/final/cutting/toolpath2.png" width=800></a>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/toolpath3.png"><img src="images/final/cutting/toolpath3.png" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>Next we will be adding tabs which will ensure that the cut out pieces will still be attached to the wood during cutting so as to avoid inaccuracy during cutting as it might move about witout tabs. To do so, simply click on the <b>Add tabs</b> box and click on <b>Edit Tabs</b>. Here, we can either automatically add tabs to our drawing by clicking on <b>Add Tabs</b> or you simply just click on the places you want your tabs to be. More tabs doesnt necessarily mean its good as you have to break off more tabs after cutting. For my i placed my own tabs. </p>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/tabs1.png"><img src="images/final/cutting/tabs1.png" width=800></a>
                      <a href="images/final/cutting/tabs2.PNG"><img src="images/final/cutting/tabs2.PNG" width=800></a>
                      
                      <p>That will be all for the settings. Now just scroll all the way down and click on <b>Calculate</b> and press Ok. They will now bring you to the toolpath screen. Here you can watch a preview of the cut before you cut and all those good stuff. Once you are done, simply just click Save and proceed with the cutting.</p>
